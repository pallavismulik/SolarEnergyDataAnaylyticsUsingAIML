"AI for Sustainable Development: Optimizing Renewable Energy Systems Using AI-Powered Predictive Analytics"
-Short-Term Solar Forecasting and Battery Storage Planning for Rural Energy Management Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive analytics system for solar energy forecasting and battery optimization using AI. 
We use NSRDB solar data from four cities across Maharashtra (Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Mumbai), each representing a different meteorological subdivision. 

The project includes:

    Solar energy output forecasting using XGBoost and LSTM
    Comparative analysis of four citiesâ€™ solar potential
    Data cleaning, outlier detection, and visualization
    Battery storage optimization for irrigation and energy usage
    
The core objectives of this project include:
- **Energy forecasting**: Predicting solar energy output based on historical data to improve energy management.
- **Outlier detection and data normalization**: Cleaning the data and making it suitable for model training.
- **Solar energy optimization**: Analyzing the energy generation capacity based on weather conditions and solar data.

The project began as a data analytics exercise involving cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis, then evolved into a full research-based solution. 
We trained and compared three ML modelsâ€”XGBoost, LSTM, and SVRâ€”for their forecasting accuracy. XGBoost performed best with RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.99 and lowst MAE = 0.01. 
We also introduced rolling MAE plots for anomaly detection and Explainable AI concepts to interpret model behavior. To enhance real-world applicability, we integrated a battery planner that translates GHI forecasts into actionable storage decisions.

##  Data Preprocessing
### How to download data
### Raw Data  openei.org -> explore -> solar -> NERL -> NSRDB -> NSRDB Viewer

The raw data is sourced from the **NSRDB** solar dataset and contains hourly solar irradiance values (GHI, DHI, DNI) along with temperature, wind speed, and other environmental data. The dataset spans an entire year, with data collected for several cities in Maharashtra (Pune, Mumbai, Aurangabad, Nagpur).

### Data Cleaning
We performed the following data cleaning steps:
1. **Removing Metadata**: The first two rows in the raw data contain metadata (e.g., source, units) which were excluded from the dataset.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: We dropped columns with more than 80% missing values and filled missing data where applicable.
3. **Normalization**: We applied **MinMaxScaler** to normalize columns like GHI, temperature, and wind speed for model consistency.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Using the **IQR (Interquartile Range)** method, we detected and removed outliers that could skew model predictions.

## Feature Engineering
1. **Spectral Irradiance**: We extracted and worked with spectral data (GHI, DHI, DNI) to evaluate solar energy generation potential.
2. **Energy Generation Estimation**: Based on GHI values, we estimated the energy generated by solar panels assuming standard panel efficiency and area.
3. **Data Transformation**: We transformed columns to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores for consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We performed several visualizations to understand the distribution of key features:
- **Distribution of GHI, temperature, wind speed** using histograms.
- **Correlation heatmaps** to analyze the relationships between energy-related variables.
- **Monthly and daily trends** in GHI and temperature.

##  Model Training

###  XGBoost Model

**XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting) was implemented for **predictive modeling** to estimate solar energy output based on features like temperature, wind speed, and GHI.

#### Steps:
1. **Data Splitting**: We split the cleaned data into **training** and **testing** sets (80%-20%).
2. **Model Training**: XGBoost was trained using the relevant features (`ghi`, `temperature`, `wind_speed`) to predict solar energy generation.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: We optimized hyperparameters like learning rate and max depth to improve model performance.

#### Results:
- **Model Accuracy**: The XGBoost model provided **high accuracy** in predicting energy generation, as the solar irradiance directly affects energy output.
- **Feature Importance**: The model highlighted **GHI** as the most significant predictor of solar energy, followed by temperature and wind speed.

#### Real-World Scenario:
- In the real world, the output from this model can help energy companies predict energy production, allowing them to optimize grid distribution and manage energy storage more effectively.

###  LSTM Model

**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks were used for **time-series forecasting** of solar energy based on historical solar irradiance data.

#### Steps:
1. **Data Transformation**: Time-series data was prepared with hourly GHI values as the target variable.
2. **Model Architecture**: We used a **simple LSTM network** with a few layers to capture temporal dependencies in the solar data.
3. **Model Training**: The LSTM model was trained to predict future solar irradiance values based on past data.
4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated using **mean absolute error (MAE)** and **root mean squared error (RMSE)**.

#### Results:
- **Forecasting Accuracy**: The LSTM model provided **high accuracy** for predicting solar energy production, especially when capturing seasonal and daily patterns.
- **Performance**: The model was able to forecast energy generation for future days based on past solar radiation data.

#### Real-World Scenario:
- The LSTM model's output can be used for **day-ahead energy forecasting**, helping energy companies better plan for energy storage and distribution, and anticipate the need for backup power sources (e.g., batteries or grid support).

## ðŸ”‹ Energy Optimization & Battery Storage

The project also involved evaluating **battery storage optimization** to improve the efficiency of solar energy use. Based on predicted solar energy generation, we assessed how much energy can be stored during the day and used during the night.

### Steps:
1. **Energy Generation**: Solar energy generation was calculated using GHI, panel area, and efficiency.
2. **Energy Storage**: We modeled how excess energy generated during the day could be stored in a **battery** for later use.
3. **Battery Efficiency**: Battery losses were accounted for, with efficiency assumed to be 85%.
4. **Optimization**: We used the available energy forecasts to determine the optimal battery size for each city, ensuring energy demand is met during nighttime.

##  Results & Impact

- **Solar Energy Generation**: The XGBoost and LSTM models provided reliable predictions for energy generation based on historical solar data.
- **Battery Storage**: We successfully demonstrated how battery storage can optimize energy usage, particularly in rural areas where grid access is limited or unreliable.
- **Real-World Application**: This project can help:
  - **Solar energy developers** in rural Maharashtra estimate energy generation potential.
  - **Energy policymakers** optimize energy distribution by understanding solar energy patterns.
  - **Energy consumers** (e.g., farmers, rural households) benefit from more reliable and cost-effective solar energy systems.

##  Future Work
- **Incorporating More Data**: We plan to include additional datasets such as wind energy, temperature forecasts, and energy consumption data to further improve forecasting and optimization.
- **Advanced Battery Optimization**: Future work will involve more complex **battery optimization algorithms** and integration of different energy storage systems.
- **Real-Time Forecasting**: Implementing **real-time forecasting** models to help in daily energy management decisions.
